## About this Website

this is a website for the Yale University magazine Rumpus: a tabloid magazine for the enjoyment of people at this institution.


## About Rumpus

Rumpus is a tabloid magazine at Yale University. I'd suggest visiting the website, but...

Note that rumpus isn't affiliated with Yale University the institution and that rumpus does not represent Yale's thoughts and opinions.

## usage, hosting, and development

This website was developed with nextjs with the intention of launching on vercel. To be specific:

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


### hosting on vercel

from the nextjs readme and documents:

>The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
>
>Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details. 


### self-hosting and development

> [!note]
> an aside on requirements 
> - nodejs on your system. See [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
>- Operating systems: macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux.
>- a supported browser: 
>    - Chrome 111+
>    - Edge 111+
>    - Firefox 111+
>    - Safari 16.4+


to self-host on your own machine for development, run 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### a shoutout
>to Y/CS
>we use (or hope to use) in upcoming versions and games through the [Yalies API](https://github.com/YaleComputerSociety/Yalies) by Y/CS. this allows us to access certain directory records in the Yale Database, while also not managing ourselves the information people don't want to see online (eg if someone were to want their last name taken of the directory, we wouldn't have to handle that ourselves). Rumpus game developers would like to say thanks to Y/CS, and hope your asses remain just as voluptuous. Also please shower soon.
