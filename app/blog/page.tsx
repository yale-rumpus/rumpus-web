                                Hey again! I don't even know if this post will get released, but this
                                is intended to be part of a feature update where we introduce
                                the yankings.
                                The yanking is a yalie ranking where you can upvote or downvote your classmates.<br />
                                You may notice some things about the yankings... like how you can upvote someone infinitely. Is this a chaotic
                                uncontrolled mechanic? Yes. Is it intentional? also yes.
