                                Hey again! I don't even know if this post will get released, but this
                                is intended to be part of a feature update where we introduce
                                the yankings.
                                The yanking is a yalie ranking where you can upvote or downvote your classmates.
                                dystopian? strange? done before? definitely. but we at rumpus are here to spark chaos as usual. we're bringing this back.<br />
                                You may notice some things about the yankings... like how you can upvote someone infinitely. Is this a chaotic
                                uncontrolled mechanic? other than loading our servers with too many api requests for the poor Y/CS people to
                                keep up with, there are not many consequences. So, we decided to include this little quirk. Why? because you can also
                                infinitely downvote someone.

                                greetings rumpasauruses. After another bitchless showerless 5 hours of coding I bring you
                                yurdle.
                                yurdle is the wordle by Rumpus. every day the server picks one lucky lucky student to bestow the honor of
                                being the yurdle answer. We will display their full name graduation year and college.
                                this person has been chosen.
                                by yurdle rump-law we hereby declare their deepest darkest dirtiest sexual fantasies to be fulfilled.
                                bonus points if you send us pictures (they will be posted).
                                <br />
                                additional notes. there is NO repetition prevention. you may get chosen twice (you lucky perv).
                                ts is managed by the Y/CS yalies api. if there be something wrong (ie misspelling, not updating, randomly placed peach emoji
                                smack dab in the middle of your name)... it is hashtag not my problem. I will say on a real note it is a well managed project.
                                <br /> there are no easter eggs ! ! ! !
